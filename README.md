# Dog vs Cat Classification Model using Transfer Learning

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. We use a pretrained model which is trained for one task. This model can be retrained for a similar task with a smaller dataset.

Transfer Learning gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch

Examples: 
1. VGG-16 - Image Recognition model
2. ResNet-50
3. Inceptionv3
4. MobileNet V2
